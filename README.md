# Code Quiz - Module 4 Challenge

## Description

This code quiz was created to test your basic knowledge of Rick and Morty. Originally, the quiz was supposed to be about JavaScript but I thought this would be more fun. Please see User Story and Acceptance Criteria below: 

User Story: 

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once you click the start button, the quiz will begin and the timer will start counting down. There are five questions total. For each question right, your score will increase by one. If you get a question wrong, your time remaining will decrease. 

Once you have answered all the questions or your time has run out, your final score will show with an option to add your initials and save your score. Once you submit your initials, it will bring you to the high score screen which saves and pulls all of your scores locally until manually cleared out by clicking the clear high scores button. 

You may also restart the game from the high scores screen by clicking on restart. 

You may also view the high score screen at any time by clicking the view high scores link in the top left of the nav.
